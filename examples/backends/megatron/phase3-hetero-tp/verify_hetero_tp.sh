# Verify a heterogeneous-TP disagg stack brought up by orchestrate.sh.
#
# Checks, in order:
#   1. A greedy (temperature=0) completion streams coherent text — if the KV
#      re-shard corrupted heads, greedy output would be garbage / repeated.
#   2. The decode coordinator log shows it IMPORTED KV and SKIPPED prefill
#      (proves the resharded blocks were accepted by the prefix cache, i.e. the
#      transfer actually happened rather than silently re-prefilling).
#
# Gold-standard correctness (not done here, needs a second stack): run the same
# greedy prompt through a MATCHED-TP stack and diff the token sequences — they
# must be identical, since re-shard only moves bytes, it does not change math.
#
# Usage (inside the container, after orchestrate.sh prints PHASE3_HETERO_READY):
#     source /tmp/phase3_hetero.env
#     ./verify_hetero_tp.sh

set -uo pipefail
source /tmp/phase3_hetero.env

# Sampling temperature. Default 0 (greedy) gives deterministic output so the
# token sequence can be diffed against a matched-TP stack for the gold-standard
# correctness check. BUT greedy=0 only works once the worker maps temperature==0
# to top_k=1 (the argmax fast-path); the stock dynamo.megatron build forwards
# temperature=0 straight into torch_sampling, which then does div_(0.0) -> inf
# -> nan -> a torch.multinomial CUDA device-side assert on the prefill engine.
# To exercise the disagg/KV-reshard path without that fix loaded, override with
# a positive temperature, e.g.  TEMPERATURE=0.7 ./verify_hetero_tp.sh
# (output is then non-deterministic, so only the import check below is exact).
